# Clusters

This directory is the source of truth, and represents a 1:1 link between a directory, and a kubernetes deployment.

If you wish to create a new cluster deployment, follow the bootstrapping guide in [root level documentation link](../README.md)

Please document the purpose, and the physical location of the cluster in each directory e.g. the cluster ARN for an EKS cluster.
